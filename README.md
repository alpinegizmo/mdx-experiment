# README

## Getting started

This presentation uses [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck).

As such, you can use npm or yarn to work with it. This will launch the presentation in dev mode

``` bash
npm start
```

whereas

``` bash
npm run-script build
```

will build a standalone distribution (but you'll have to figure out how to supply the images and a web server).

## Presenting

The left and right arrow keys navigate through the slides. Option-p opens presenter mode. Option-g shows a grid with all of the slides for random access to any slide.
